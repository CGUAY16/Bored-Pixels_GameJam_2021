# Bored-Pixels_GameJam_2021
Submission for the bored pixels game jam. This is the scripts for that game

I plan to fully finish this game since there are currently alot of bugs for this. It is also good practice for fixing bugs. There will be another folder that is the final version of this game.

Edit(1): Patch 1.02 of The Day Of Wrath was released around october 18-20. which includes alot of changes to objects used and additions for future mechanics that are not finalized or just in the prototype phase. I've added the scripts for this version in the newest folder.
